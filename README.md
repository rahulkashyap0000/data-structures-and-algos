# Data Structures and Algorithms
I hope that this contains algorithms and their workings. I would really love to revise using this.

## Tree Search Alorithms

First we look at some tree search algorithms like

- Depth First Search

- Breadth First Search

- Uniform Cost Search

- Iterative Deepening

- A* Search Algorithm

and their complexities.
